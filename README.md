## Introduction

(Introduction content)

## Usage

### Clone this repo

(TODO: add npm package location)

`git clone git@github.com:wellcometrust/design-system.git`

### Node version and NVM

The Wellcome Design System repo uses Node v15.0.1. It is strongly recommended that you install [NVM](http://nvm.sh/) on your local machine to easily manage multiple versions of Node.

To help in setting the correct node version, an .nvmrc file is contained in the root folder. Running `nvm use` from the command line will automatically pick up the version named in the .nvmrc file and set this as the node version for the current terminal window.

### Installation

```
npm install
```

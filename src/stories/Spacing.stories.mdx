# Spacing

Spacing metrics are used to ensure that individual elements on a page and across a site are consistently spaced. They are based on `rem` units which adapt their size to browser zoom.

Pixels should only be specified as the unit in instances where a dimension doesn't alter, for example borders and keylines.


# Responsive spacing units

 We provide spacing rules for large, medium and small screen sizes and these should be used to build consistency across responsive sites.

## Static spacing

The default space unit or `--space-unit` is 0.5rem (equivalent to 8 pixels at 100% zoom) and this is the basis for each of the responsive spacing metrics above.

Static spacings which remain consistent across breakpoints are currently in development. 

```

## Installation

Spacing CSS variables are included in the **core.css** stylesheet.

Import into SASS

```scss
import '@wellcometrust/design-system';

// or 
import '@wellcometrust/design-system/dist/core.css'
```

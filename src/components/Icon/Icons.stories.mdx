# Iconography
To meet accessibility requirements, icons used within a call to action need a minimum 44px by 44px tappable area.

By default, icons are 24px by 24px (rendered using rems in CSS). The tappable area can be previewed by hovering over each icon in the preview below.

Icons can of course be used for providing styling to non-interactive elements, in which case the 44px by 44px area is not required.

## Icon colours
You are free to use the icons in any colour from the Wellcome palette. The red and green shown below are to be used for error and success messaging.

<ColorPaletteStatus />

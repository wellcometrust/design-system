# Iconography
To meet accessibility requirements, icons used within a call to action need a minimum 44px by 44px tappable area.

By default, icons are 24px by 24px (rendered using rems in CSS). The tappable area can be previewed by hovering over each icon in the preview below.

Icons can of course be used for providing styling to non-interactive elements, in which case the 44px by 44px area is not required.

## Icon colours
You are free to use the icons in any colour from the Wellcome palette. The red and green shown below are to be used for error and success messaging.

<ColoursPaletteStatus />

### Development note
Icon HTML is wrapped in a `<span>` element. The SVG contained within this span has a default **fill** of `currentColor` which means that it will automatically use the **color** of the containing HTML. No colour is specified for the span itself but this can be set very easily using CSS.

```html
<!-- sample HTML output -->
<span class="ds-icon" aria-hidden="true">
  <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24">
    <path d="M12 0c6.627 0 12 5.373 12 12s ... 1.415 0z" fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd"></path>
  </svg>
</span>
```

## Small icons
The small icons detailed below have a simpler design than their standard size (24px by 24px) counterparts and have a default size of 16px by 16px.

<SmallIcons/>

## Icon props
Height and width styles are automatically set in CSS depending on the icon name used e.g. `name="iconActionEdit"` will render at the standard size (24px by 24px), `name="iconSmallActionEdit"` will render at the smaller size (16px by 16px).

Overrides can be made through CSS or may be provided as props. Props should include the unit type as they will be rendered in a **style** attribute.
